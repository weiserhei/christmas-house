SPE Presets
-----------

The files in this folder are preset options for `SPE.Emitter` instances. Use them however you want: as a starting point for creating the effect you want, or as-is.

I've tried to cover as many emitter variations as possible without providing an overwhelming number of them, but if you'd like to see a particular effect either create it yourself and submit a pull-request, or let me know and I'll add it when I can.
