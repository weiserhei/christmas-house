SPE Dev Todo List
=================

* ~~General optimization.~~
* ~~Add Browserify support (see [here](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine/pull/62))~~.
* ~~Add Bower support (see [here](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine/pull/76)).~~
	* ~~Credit @giuliandrimba for bower.json.~~
* Add unit tests.
* Look into using FBO to store particle positions.
	* Will enable Curl Noise, Gravity Wells, etc.
* ~~Full documentation.~~
* Tutorials/guides.
* Triangle distribution option.
* Angle velocity (see [here](https://github.com/squarefeet/ShaderParticleEngine/pull/25)).
* Look into adding proper angleAlignVelocity support.
* [Publish to NPM](https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/1318304)

* Custom distribution type?
* Indexed points on sphere (num points, use particle index as counter)
* Use of texture maps (more than one texture per image)
	* Emitter can control offset, size.
	* How to work this in with spritesheet support?
